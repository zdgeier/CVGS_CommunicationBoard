# CVGS_CommunicationBoard
Spring 2016

This is the start of an iPad app written in the Swift programming language for people who have trouble speaking. The app is a soundboard of simple buttons that trigger a virtual voice.

Unfortuately I abandoned this project due the loss of access to resources required to release an iPad app (an expensive Mac computer and developer license).
